# Contributing

Thanks love because you would contribute! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

I, Ukuejubola Kelvin Oritsetimeyin (ðŸŽ‰kelvinsekxðŸŽ‰), is honoured to seee you here and donot take any of your contributions for granted. I really appreciate your effort at making LetterLoading awesome loaded.

## Dev

- Clone the repository to your local machine (PC in short)

```
git clone ...
cd letterloading
```

- Install all required dependencies. But before you do, ensure node is installed on your PC. OK ?

```
npm install
```

- Start the server, and everything appears on the browser for you. 
Start breaking the library, 

```
npm start
```

## If you just added some cool stuff, or  deducted some ugly stuff
- check out your stuff on your browser firstly, by using

`npm run build`

on your terminal. Then try to see the resulting changes on your devserver.

- If you've done the above, YAY!!! You can now create a repo and add the new letterloading
- Tell us you made some cool stuff as clear as possible
- We will love your contributions
