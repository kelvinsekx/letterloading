# LetterLoading

LetterLoading js is a javascript library for making awesome letter simulations. It default simulation is a letter loading simulation.

# Core concept of LetterLoading.

- **flexibility:**
This is because it is intended from ground up to do than just loading letter simulation. It could be extended to achieve even more animation simulation.
- **robustness:**
LetterLoading gives you the possibility to break it and achieve even more simulation.
